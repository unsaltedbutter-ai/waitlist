    "answer": "Straight talk from one bitcoiner to another: I built this because I wanted it, and I use it myself. If you want to get to know me first, DM me on Nostr:\n npub197wnmww44hz60kdry7mme3mqsk7tx683yl26f0n5t29lhxad7lhq3kh3pt\nFrom a technical perspective: your credentials are encrypted with libsodium sealed boxes (X25519 + XSalsa20-Poly1305). The encryption key lives on the web server, but the decryption key lives on a completely separate computer on a private network. Even if the database and web server were both compromised, your credentials could not be decrypted. They are never logged in plaintext and destroyed immediately if you delete your account.\nhttps://github.com/unsaltedbutter-ai/waitlist"
