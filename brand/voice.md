# Brand Voice Guide — UnsaltedButter.ai

## Core Identity

UnsaltedButter is a subscription rotation service disguised as a quiet rebellion. The name is the joke: we churn subscriptions like churning butter. The ".ai" is literal — AI does the work. The brand never explains the name. People either get it or they don't.

## Two Modes of Voice

### Dark / Mysterious (the edges)
Used on: waitlist, onboarding commitment page, 404, 500, footer, invite emails, empty states.

This is the Fight Club layer. Not the violence — the social commentary. Consumer identity crisis. The realization that you're paying $80/month to seven corporations for the privilege of scrolling through content you'll never watch. The quiet decision to stop.

**Tone:** Conspiratorial. Knowing. Like passing a note under the table. Never loud, never edgy-for-the-sake-of-edgy. The confidence of someone who already opted out.

**Examples:**
- "You were not supposed to find this."
- "The first rule is there are no rules. There's just one subscription at a time."
- "Welcome back. We didn't save your place."

### Clean / Functional (the product)
Used on: dashboard, queue management, rotation calendar, settings, account page.

Once someone is inside, they need clarity. The dashboard is a tool, not a manifesto. Status messages are direct. Labels are obvious. The user should never wonder what a button does.

**Tone:** Calm, precise, professional. Like a Bloomberg terminal for your Netflix queue. No jokes in the UI chrome. Let the data speak.

**Examples:**
- "Netflix — active through Mar 14"
- "Hulu — scheduled to start Mar 15"
- "Cancel failed. You need to cancel manually. Here's the link."

## Vocabulary

### We Say
- "rotation" (not "switching" or "cycling")
- "queue" (not "list" or "lineup")
- "membership" (our service, not theirs)
- "subscription" (their streaming services)
- "spots are limited" (never a number)
- "credential" (what they give us)
- "destroy" (what happens to data on membership end — not "delete" or "remove")
- "margin call" (renewal reminders)
- "the butter churns" (internal: rotation is working)

### We Never Say
- "free trial" — ever, anywhere, for any reason
- "5,000" or any specific user cap number
- "hack" or "exploit" — we're not breaking anything
- "bot" or "automated" on user-facing surfaces — we say "the service handles it"
- "AI" in marketing copy — the domain says it, that's enough
- "cancel culture" — wrong connotation entirely
- "cheap" or "budget" — this is about principle, not penny-pinching
- "disrupting" — we are not a TechCrunch pitch deck
- "cord-cutting" in a positive frame — cord-cutting recreated the cable bundle, that's the problem

### Streaming Pain Point (how we frame it)
The pitch is NOT "save money on streaming." The pitch is:

> You cut the cord to escape the bundle. Then every studio launched their own service. Now you're paying more than cable ever cost, for content split across eight apps. You watch one at a time anyway. We formalize that.

This reframes the user as someone who sees the absurdity — not someone looking for a deal.

## Fight Club Usage Guidelines

Fight Club is social commentary about consumer identity, not an aesthetic of destruction. We use it as a lens, not a costume.

### Do
- Reference the themes: rejecting consumption as identity, opting out of systems designed to extract, the absurdity of paying for things you don't use
- Use the cadence: short declarative sentences, second person, present tense
- Evoke the feeling: you know something others don't, you made a choice they haven't
- Create original lines that capture the spirit

### Don't
- Quote the movie directly (copyright, and it's hacky)
- Reference violence, soap, or specific plot points
- Use "his name is Robert Paulson" or any meme-ified lines
- Make it feel like a Hot Topic t-shirt
- Overdo it — one dark line per page is enough, two is the absolute max

### The Underlying Message
You're not saving money. You're refusing to be the product. Eight streaming services don't compete for your attention because they respect you. They compete because your monthly payment is a rounding error you won't notice. Until you do.

## Bitcoin / Sovereignty Culture

Our users are Bitcoiners. They already think in terms of self-custody, sovereignty, opting out of legacy systems. The streaming rotation pitch maps directly to their worldview: why pay rent to seven landlords when you only live in one room?

### Do
- Assume financial literacy — they know what a margin call is
- Use BTC-native metaphors naturally (not forced)
- Respect the self-custody ethos: their data, their credentials, destroyed when they leave
- "Diamond hands" internally — we hold all BTC revenue, never convert to fiat

### Don't
- "To the moon" or any price speculation language
- Laser eyes, rocket emojis, or any crypto-bro aesthetic
- Imply BTC payment is a novelty — it's just how payment works here
- Explain what Bitcoin is — if they're here, they know

## Formatting Rules

- Headings: sentence case, not title case ("Your rotation queue" not "Your Rotation Queue")
- No exclamation marks in UI copy. Ever. Excitement is noise.
- Em dashes over semicolons for dramatic pauses in dark copy.
- Periods at the end of standalone sentences. No trailing ellipses (...) except in loading states.
- Monospace or code-style for technical values (npub keys, invoice IDs).
