# Logo Design Brief — UnsaltedButter.ai

## Brand Summary

UnsaltedButter is a streaming subscription rotation service. Invite-only, BTC-only, capped membership. The brand is quiet, confident, and slightly subversive — Fight Club's consumer identity crisis, not its violence. The name is a churn metaphor: churning subscriptions like churning butter.

## Logo Requirements

### Wordmark
- "UnsaltedButter" as one word, no space, or "Unsalted Butter" with a space — test both
- The ".ai" may or may not appear in the logo — it should work either way
- Must be legible at small sizes (favicon, mobile nav, 32px)
- Must work on dark backgrounds (primary use case) and light backgrounds (secondary)

### Icon / Mark
Explore these directions (in order of preference):

1. **Butter churn** — a minimal, geometric butter churn silhouette. The barrel shape is distinctive and unusual enough to be ownable. Could work as a standalone favicon.

2. **Butter pat with rotation** — a square butter pat with a subtle rotation/cycle indicator (an arrow curving around it, a circular cut mark). Risks being too cute.

3. **Abstract rotation mark** — geometric shape suggesting cyclical movement. Clean, but loses the butter connection.

4. **Typography-only** — no icon, just a strong wordmark. The name is distinctive enough to carry this. Viable fallback.

Do NOT explore: streaming-related icons (play buttons, TV screens, remotes), Bitcoin symbols in the logo, skulls or Fight Club imagery, melting butter, toast.

## Color Palette

### Primary (dark theme — this is the default)
- **Background:** Near-black. Not pure #000000. Something like #0A0A0A or #111111.
- **Primary text:** Off-white. #E8E8E8 or similar. Not pure white.
- **Accent:** A single warm accent color. Butter-adjacent but not literal yellow. Explore:
  - Warm amber: #D4A843 (golden, aged, serious)
  - Muted gold: #B8960C (darker, more restrained)
  - Pale butter: #E8D44D (brighter, riskier — could feel cheap)
  - Burnt orange is NOT butter. Avoid.
- **Secondary accent:** One cool neutral for borders, dividers, muted text. Dark gray range: #2A2A2A to #3A3A3A.
- **Error/warning:** Muted red, not aggressive. Something like #C44040.
- **Success:** Muted green. #3A7D44 or similar.

### Secondary (light theme — optional, low priority)
If a light mode is ever needed, invert conservatively. The product is designed dark-first.

## Typography Direction

- **Headings:** A geometric sans-serif with personality. Not generic (no Inter, no Helvetica). Explore: Space Grotesk, Darker Grotesque, General Sans, Satoshi. Should feel modern and slightly unconventional without being illegible.
- **Body:** A highly legible sans-serif. Could be the same family as headings at a lighter weight, or a complementary face. Readability over personality for body text.
- **Monospace (for technical values):** JetBrains Mono, IBM Plex Mono, or similar. Used for npub keys, invoice IDs, hashes.

## Usage Constraints

- Logo must work at: favicon (16x16, 32x32), mobile nav bar (~40px height), desktop nav (~48px height), and full-size marketing (300px+)
- Horizontal lockup (icon + wordmark side by side) is the primary format
- Icon-only version must be recognizable without the wordmark
- No gradients in the icon — must work as a single-color silhouette
- Must reproduce cleanly in monochrome (white on dark, dark on light)

## What to Avoid

- Anything that looks like a fintech startup
- Anything that looks like a crypto project (no blockchain aesthetics, no hexagons)
- Cartoonish or playful illustration style — the brand is dry, not fun
- Overly complex marks that won't survive at small sizes
- Trendy design that will feel dated in 2 years (no blob shapes, no 3D renders)
- Literal depictions of streaming content (no film reels, no play buttons)

## Reference Mood

If forced to point at existing brands for tone (not imitation):
- **Linear** — clean, dark, precise, developer-adjacent
- **Raycast** — geometric, confident, restrained color
- **Arc Browser** — slightly unconventional but still professional
- **Nothing (phone brand)** — industrial, intentional, anti-flashy

The logo should feel like it belongs to a company that doesn't need to explain itself.
