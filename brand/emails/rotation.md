# Rotation Notification Email

One email per rotation. Clean, informational, brief. This is a status update, not marketing.

## Subject Line
Your rotation: {{old_service}} winding down {{end_date}}, {{new_service}} starts {{start_date}}

## Preheader Text
Your streaming rotation is updating.

## Body

Your rotation is updating.

**{{old_service}}** is winding down around **{{end_date}}**. The gift card balance will run out and the service ends naturally — no cancellation involved.

**{{new_service}}** starts **{{start_date}}**. We'll buy a gift card and activate it for you.

No action needed on your part.

## Variant: First Rotation (no previous service)

**Subject:** Your first rotation: {{new_service}} starts {{start_date}}

**Body:**

Your first rotation is live.

**{{new_service}}** starts **{{start_date}}**. We're activating your subscription now.

When the gift card runs out, the service ends naturally and we'll activate the next service in your queue. You don't need to do anything.
