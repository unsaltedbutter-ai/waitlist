# Invite Email

## Subject Line
You've been invited.

## Preheader Text
Someone thought you should see this.

## Body

Someone you know is a member of UnsaltedButter.

They think you'd be a good fit. We tend to agree — we don't let members hand out invites carelessly.

UnsaltedButter rotates your streaming subscriptions so you only pay for one at a time. No overlap. No wasted months. No effort on your part. One subscription, every month, on repeat.

Spots are limited. This invite expires in 7 days.

**[Accept your invite →]** {{invite_url}}

You'll need Bitcoin (Lightning Network) and at least two streaming services to get started.

If you didn't expect this, ignore it. If you don't know what this is, that's by design.

## Footer
You received this because a current member invited you. We will not email you again unless you accept.
