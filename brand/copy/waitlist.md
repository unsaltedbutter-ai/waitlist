## Success Message
**Heading:** You're on the list.
**Body:** When a spot opens, you'll know. Check your email — we don't do push notifications, we don't do apps, and we definitely don't do social media announcements. If you gave us an npub, watch for a DM there too.

## Duplicate Rejection
You're already on the list. We didn't forget about you.

## Footer Text
Spots are limited. UnsaltedButter is an invite-only service. No public signups, no launch day, no countdown timer. When it's your turn, it's your turn.
