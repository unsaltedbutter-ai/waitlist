## Step 1: Commitment / Disclaimer

### Page Title
Before we begin.

### Body
UnsaltedButter manages your streaming subscriptions by signing up for services on your behalf. We buy gift cards with your BTC balance to activate services. When the gift card balance runs out, the service ends naturally — no cancellation needed.

This works. But it is not magic, and you need to understand how it works.

### Gift Card Disclaimer (bold, prominent — not buried)
**We purchase gift cards to activate your streaming services. When the gift card balance runs out, the service ends naturally. No cancellation needed, no risk of extra charges.**

### Additional Terms
- Your streaming credentials are encrypted at rest and destroyed immediately if your membership ends.
- We buy gift cards with your BTC balance to activate services. Gift card codes are encrypted and destroyed after redemption.
- We never store screenshots containing your personal information.
- We do not share your data with anyone. There is no one to share it with.
- Membership is $9.99/month, deducted from your BTC balance.
- No refunds for partial months except at our discretion.

## Step 2: Add Streaming Credentials

### Page Title
Your streaming accounts

### Instruction Text
Add the login credentials for each streaming service you want in your rotation. We need these to sign up on your behalf using gift cards. If you have an existing subscription, let it lapse or cancel it — we'll resubscribe with a gift card when your turn comes.

### Per-Service Form
**Service selector:** Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, HBO Max, Paramount+, Peacock, Apple TV+
**Email/username field label:** Login email
**Password field label:** Password
**Helper text:** Use a strong, unique password. We encrypt it immediately. You can update it anytime.

### Add Another Service

### Minimum Services Notice
Add at least two services to enable rotation. One service alone has nothing to rotate with.

## Step 3: Set Rotation Order

### Page Title
Your rotation queue

### Instruction Text
Drag to reorder. The service at the top starts first. Each service stays active until the gift card runs out (roughly 30–40 days), then the next one in line activates. The queue loops — after the last service, it starts over at the top.

### Empty State
No services added yet. Go back and add at least two.

### Queue Item Format
[drag handle] [service icon] Service Name

### Cycle Length Note
Each rotation is roughly 30–40 days depending on gift card value vs. monthly price. Some variation is normal.

## Step 4: Prepay for Service

### Page Title
Prepay for service

### Instruction Text
Your service credits cover everything: membership ($9.99/mo) and gift card purchases for your streaming services. Add credits in any amount via Lightning Network. More credits = more rotations without interruption.

### Payment Flow
Scan the Lightning invoice QR code or copy the invoice to pay from any Lightning wallet. Your credits update instantly.

### QR Display

### Invoice Copy
[Copy invoice string]

### CTA Button
Add service credits

### Post-Payment Confirmation
**Heading:** Credits added.
**Body:** Your credits are loaded. Your first rotation starts within 24 hours — we'll buy a gift card for the top service in your queue and activate it. After that, everything is automatic. Check your dashboard anytime — but you won't need to.
